        <h3 style="margin-bottom: 20px;"> Getting a service member to seek professional help for mental health
        </h3>
        <p>
            Drawing from the goldsmith’s (2004) theory, researchers try to answer some questions about the dilemmas that
            family members face when they are talking with the returning service members [SMs] about seeking
            professional
            help for PTSD. Also, they are studying the ways family members are approaching their SMs and encourage them
            to
            seek professional mental help if they are experiencing issues integrating with their normal daily life. They
            are
            trying to address these two questions: first, what dilemma do family members experience when talking with
            service members [SMs] about seeking mental healthcare? Second, what strategies do family members recommend
            using
            when attempting to navigate these dilemmas?</p>
        <p>
            The study procedure included eighty family members of U.S. service members [SMs] filling out an anonymous
            survey. The SMs served in Iraq or Afghanistan and the family members were asked how they would respond to
            scenarios where their SM was experiencing some sort of mental illness including depression, post-traumatic
            stress or overall difficulty integrating back into civilian life. Family members described their goal of
            outcome
            when talking to their SM, difficulties they may face, and advice they would give to other families with SMs.
            “Dilemma” was defined as situations where a family member’s communication was misconstrued by the SM, and
            four
            dilemmas that frequently came up when talking about mental health included: “(a) getting [the SM] to
            recognize
            the problem without implying [they’re] not normal, (b) convincing [the SM] to seek help without implying
            [they’re] weak, (c) being persistent but patient, and (d) wanting [the SM] to open up without implying [the
            family member] can understand”. Furthermore, the family members discussed how they managed these dilemmas,
            which
            encourages better support for military families and policy changes that acknowledge the deep-seated cultural
            problem of mental health stigmas.</p>
        
            <div class="col-10">
                <img src="./image/diagnostic ptsd.jpg" alt="" width="100%">
            </div>
            <p>
            The analysis also revealed four groups of strategies that family members may use to manage dilemmas. First
            is
            When to talk, and this strategy focuses on making choices about when and how often to bring up help-seeking
            and
            how much to say about the topic to keep SMs from withdrawing or avoiding. The second is how to talk, and in
            this
            strategy family members must communicate caring and commitment along with being polite and showing respect.
            They
            also must listen to SMs nonjudgmentally. The third is how to frame it and this strategy focuses on how to
            frame
            the talk positively and cooperatively to encourage SMs to seek help as becoming healthy, happy, and
            productive
            and in this case SM and family members will seek help together to show that the SM does not have to face the
            issue alone. The last strategy is where else to turn, and this strategy focuses on seeking help from a third
            party to speak with the SM about his or her issues. This involves another SM or veteran to either persuade
            or
            encourage him or her to seek help. Sometimes this third party could involve religious resources such as a
            place
            or person to turn when seeking help or turning to God as a third party and praying with the SM on the issue.

            This finding is supporting our previous work on social determinants of health and shows the challenges that
            a
            person has in communicating the issue, especially when the issue is regarding mental or physical health. In
            this
            article, family members look to find a way to communicate with their service members by implementing one or
            a
            combination of the strategies mentioned previously and encourages them to seek professional help for their
            issue. We mentioned earlier in the social determinants of health about interpersonal communication, which
            was
            one of the challenges that patients face during an occurrence of an illness or disease. In conclusion, when
            a
            health problem arises, either physical or mental, if the patient does not feel ready to seek professional
            help,
            sometimes family members or friends should find a way to encourage the patient to seek help at a right time
            without implying weakness or pressure. This process needs patience and persistence to reach the desired
            goal.
