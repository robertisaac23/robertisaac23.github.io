            <h4>Facts n’ Figures</h4>
            <div class="col-6">
                <p>Post-Traumatic Stress, also known as PTS, is a psychological problem that can occur after
                    experiencing or witnessing
                    a traumatic event. A traumatic event includes a sense of horror, helplessness, serious injury, or a
                    fear that your
                    life or others’ lives are in danger. A traumatic event is subjective but the event can include a
                    natural disaster,
                    military/war combat, a major accident, violence, abuse, death, sexual assault, racism, or
                    discrimination. PTS is a
                    common, normal reaction to a traumatic event however, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a
                    medically diagnosed
                    condition with more severe and persistent PTS symptoms. Throughout this blog we will be using PTS
                    and PTSD
                    interchangeably to help deviate away from the stereotypes and stigmatization associated with PTSD.
                    Also, please note
                    if you or a loved one exhibits any of these symptoms, it’s important to acknowledge you are not at
                    fault for the
                    traumatizing events experienced or the way you cope with the stress. We recommend getting tested by
                    your healthcare
                    provider as soon as possible before symptoms might get worse.

            <h4>Who is affected?</h4>
            <p>In the past, PTSD was mostly in relation to war veterans and was known as “shell shock” or “combat
                fatigue”. Now,
                researchers understanding PTSD can affect all people, of any ethnicity, nationality, culture, or age.
                The World
                Health Organization conducted a worldwide survey and found that 70.4% of the respondents experienced
                lifetime
                traumas (Kessler, 2017). In the United States, about 8% of people will have PTSD some time in their
                lives. However,
                different groups are disproportionately affected. Women are twice as likely to experience PTSD than men
                and U.S.
                Latino, African American, and First Nations people have higher rates of PTSD than white people. PTSD is
                also
                prevalent in the LGBTQ+ community and is reported much higher than national studies done on the general
                public
                (Alessi, 2013). Particularly, visibly gender non-conforming people are significantly more vulnerable to
                violence and
                discrimination, which can lead to PTSD (Reisner, 2016). Children and young adults in the U.S. also
                experience PTSD
                with a percentage as high as 15%. Check out our blog entry on <a href="./media.html">PTS in the
                    media</a> to get a better
                understanding of the
                possible reasons why some communities are disproportionately affected more than others.
            </p>
            <h4>Symptoms</h4>
            <p>While many experience traumatizing events and PTS, not everyone will develop chronic PTSD. To diagnose
                adults, medical doctors use a diagnostic criterion called the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
                Mental Disorders (DSM-5). According to the DSM-5, symptoms can begin within three months to a few years
                after the event. Symptoms include intrusion symptoms, avoidance, negative alterations in cognition and
                mood, and alteration in arousal and reactivity (Brainline).<br>
                <strong>Intrusion</strong> symptoms include re-experiencing the traumatic event through memories,
                nightmares, or
                flashbacks. <strong>Avoidance</strong> is defined as avoiding thoughts or feelings related to the trauma
                or avoiding
                places, events or objects that could be a reminder of the trauma. <strong>Cognition and mood
                    alterations</strong> can
                include inability to remember key features of the trauma, increase in negative thoughts, feelings of
                blame, guilt, or isolation, and decreased interest in activities. Lastly, <strong>alterations in arousal
                    and
                    reactivity</strong> involve irritability or aggression, risky or destructive behavior, increased
                alertness,
                difficulty concentrating, and difficulty sleeping. After a traumatic event, it is normal to experience
                symptoms for a few weeks but once they exceed over a month it could be diagnosed as PTSD. Additionally,
                children and adolescents may react differently to traumatic events than adults. Children under 6 years
                old may wet their bed, forget how to or unable to talk, or become unusually clingy with a parent or
                adult. Older children and teens are more likely to show symptoms similar to adults. To get a better
                understanding of these symptoms, check out our entry on <a href="./personExper.html">personal
                    experiences</a> for examples.

        <h4>Treatment</h4>
        <p>Everyone is unique in regards to their symptoms so treatment may differ between survivors. The most common
            treatment
            includes cognitive processing therapy (CPT), prolonged exposure therapy (PE), or stress inoculation training
            (SIT)
            (PTSD Facts). CPT aims to help the patient identify how they view themselves, others, and the world around
            them in
            relation to the trauma and use that new perspective to create constructive ways of thinking. PE is a gradual
            process
            that helps individuals confront the trauma-related memories and emotions in a safe and guided environment.
            Lastly,
            SIT is about teaching coping skills to deal with the stress that comes with PTSD. SIT can include breathing
            exercises, muscle relaxation, cognitive restructuring, and assertiveness skills. For children, studies show
            Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) is best (Bastien, 2020). TF-CBT is more or less a
            combination
            of the three therapies mentioned above. The most common medication for PTSD is selective serotonin reuptake
            inhibitors (SSRIs), which are antidepressants used to ease depressed mood and anxiety. Complementary and
            alternative
            treatments can be effective as well, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation, acupuncture, relaxation
            techniques,
            and meditation (Wahbeh, 2014).<br>

            PTS and other stress and trauma related disorders are the most prevalent mental illnesses that affect us
            today.
            However, PTSD is a treatable condition and hopefully with these resources you can find what works best for
            you or
            your loved one. If you have any other questions or would like more information please check the citations

            <strong>Remember, if you or someone you care about struggles with PTSD or any other mental illness, don’t
                hesitate to get
                support. You are not alone.</strong>
