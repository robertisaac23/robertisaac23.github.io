            <p>
                PTS is a mental health condition that is often seen portrayed in the media in a serious and educational
                light.
                Let’s not confuse PTS (a condition that is present for an estimated month) with PTSD (a disorder that is
                present
                for a longer duration of time). These days, mental health has been a widely recognized topic and luckily
                has
                received notable coverage across many outlets. Some of these outlets are social media, news articles,
                television
                shows and movies, and website/blog dedications to the many different types of mental health illnesses.
                PTS
                is
                seen to be a part of these many different outlets, being explained. Although, there is advances in media
                coverage, there is also room for improvement and inclusion of different demographics as well.
            </p>
            <div class="col-6">
                <p>
                    The media does a good job in defining what PTS actually is as articles explain that it is, “a
                    common,
                    normal,
                    and often adaptive response to experiencing a traumatic or stressful event” (Bender, 2018). The
                    problem with
                    the
                    media portrayal is that oftentimes, PTS is seen as a violent mental health disorder due to the
                    associations
                    that
                    PTS has with war and focus on uncommon symptoms such as depression, flashbacks, and nightmares
                    (Newman,
                    2018).
                    This creates a fear within the readers minds of those who are dealing with PTS, as well as confusion
                    for
                    individuals looking for clarity in the symptoms. Personally, I have fallen victim to this exact
                    thinking as
                    well
                    when doing research on the topic. In addition to its negative portrayal, articles in the media about
                    PTS
                    have
                    begun to include less entries about survival and treatment options, which has deteriorated the
                    optimism of
                    those
                    who are looking to overcome PTS (Newman, 2018). While doing research, I became apparent to me that
                    treatment
                    seemed to be scarce and as a reader, even I felt a lack of encouragement. Looking less into the
                    negative
                    aspects
                    of media portrayal, we can see how the media has allowed for the conversation to start and create a
                    platform
                    for
                    regular civilians (not only veterans) to speak about their own experiences.

            <p>
                As mentioned before, media sources often associate PTS with veterans and older adults. This
                misconception
                that
                only veterans get PTS has created a separation for those who do not fall into this category who are
                currently
                dealing with PTS. This includes sexual assault victims, trumatic accident surviviors, abuse etc. In
                addition, a
                demographic that doesn’t seem to be highlighted often in the media is PTS in children. PTS in children
                can
                occur
                when they are exposed to traumatic events such as sexual/physical/emotional abuse, tragic accidents, or
                even
                death. The numbers show that on average children face different types of traumatic events that can lead
                to
                the
                development of PTS and it is as follows:
            <ul>
                <li>65% neglect</li>
                <li>18% physical abuse</li>
                <li>10% sexual abuse</li>
                <li>7% psychological (mental) abuse</li>
                (US Department of Veteran Affairs, 2019)
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                These different traumatic events can contribute to PTS in children and teenagers, however, can be hard
                for
                them
                to find resources due to the neglect that this demographic faces in the light of PTS.
            </p>
            <p>In addition to the demographic of children being disregarded, it appears that another group of
                individuals
                that
                relate to children are also being pushed aside. An often disregarded population of PTS is that of
                parents,
                those
                who have children and are suffering from the effects of the disorder. Parents with PTS are occasionally
                seen
                displaying negative effects towards children such as hitting, yelling, or irritability (Christie, 2019).
                Another
                downside to PTS is the idea that PTS has caused a shift in the activities that parents are able to do
                with
                their
                children. Some parents may find it difficult to participate in activities such as going to the movies,
                being
                around noisy activities, going to shopping centers, etc (Christie, 2019). These effects of PTS can
                create a
                hostel environment for families that parents aren’t necessarily always aware of. What they often are
                aware
                of is
                their love for their children.</p>
            <p>The correlation between PTS and minorities are also a subject that the media does not showcase to the
                public.
                Minorities can face numerous amounts of stress due to racial injustices and as the article by Monnica T.
                Williams explains, “When traumatization is due to experiences of racism it is sometimes called racial
                trauma.
                Racial trauma can result from major experiences of racism such as workplace discrimination or hate
                crimes,
                or it
                can be the result of an accumulation of many small occurrences, such as everyday discrimination and
                microaggressions” (Williams, 2019). I personally can account for a time where I was discriminated
                against at
                a
                store and it caused me to have mild PTS whenever I’d recall that moment. What this means for minorities
                is
                that
                the stress they receive from these injustices in the workplace, public, and even home can create the
                foundation
                for PTS to be present. A concept that the media seems to disregard and has created a difficult outlet
                for
                minorities to receive assistance.</p>
            <p>The media has presented PTS in an educational light where it has allowed individuals the ability to
                search up
                the meaning of what the term is, symptoms associated with the term, and personal accounts of others with
                the
                same diagnosis. The media has been a useful tool and with further additions such as the different
                demographics,
                definitions, and expanding on experiences the term PTS in the media can be further developed into a
                resourceful
                term for a wide variety of individuals.</p>
