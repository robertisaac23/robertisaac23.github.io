            Post-Traumatic Stress, also known as PTS, is a psychological problem that can occur after experiencing or
            witnessing a traumatic event. A traumatic event includes a sense of horror, helplessness, serious injury, or
            a fear that your life or others’ lives are in danger. A traumatic event is subjective but the event can
            include a natural disaster, military/war combat, a major accident, violence, abuse, death, sexual assault,
            racism, or discrimination. PTS is a common, normal reaction to a traumatic event however, Post-Traumatic
            Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a medically diagnosed condition with more severe and persistent PTS symptoms.
            Throughout this blog we will be using PTS and PTSD interchangeably to help deviate away from the stereotypes
            and stigmatization associated with PTSD. Also, please note if you or a loved one exhibits any of these
            symptoms, it’s important to acknowledge you are not at fault for the traumatizing events experienced or the
            way you cope with the stress. We recommend getting tested by your healthcare provider as soon as possible
            before symptoms might get worse.<br>

            Many people have their own experiences of dealing with PTS and PTSD, and how they sort of cope and handle it
            throughout their day to day life. Sharing these stories can help the next person who may be mentally, and
            emotionally struggling and feeling alone in experience with this. In this post on Anxiety and Depression
            Association of America, P.K. Philips shares her story as a survivor of battling PTSD, and being diagnosed at
            the age of 35 after suffering from it most of her life. Philips’ PTSD, is triggered from several traumatic
            events such as physical, mental, and sexual abuse as a child, and also, an attack at knifepoint. These
            traumatic events left Philips feeling like there was no safe place for her, which led to her denying help
            that could have been critical early on in her life to understand what she experienced and how that could
            have affected her. Philips suffered from flashbacks, nightmares, and her first panic attack by the age of
            17. After a few years, after what they thought was recovery, another traumatic event happened, triggering
            the PTSD all over again. After 32 years of not knowing what was causing the feeling of anxiety, panic
            attacks, and overall stress; she finally was properly diagnosed and treated with medication and behavior
            therapy. Philips going all those years of not being health literate in what she was experiencing.<br>

            Veterans Health Administration documents Teresa’s story via Youtube. Teresa is an army veteran that suffers
            from PTSD triggered by an accident from a roadside bomb where one truck had no survivors. She injured her
            back, head, and arm, and the passenger where she was supposed to be sitting, injured their entire right
            side. She was then diagnosed with PTSD when she came back from serving in 2004. She experienced nightmares
            and daily panic attacks, which was treated with sleeping pills and anxiety medication. When the sleeping
            pills would stop working, she would have breakthrough dreams, retriggering her PTSD and left her with the
            feeling of not wanting to do anything. After hitting a boiling point of lashing out at work, she was able to
            meet with a counselor that helped her deal with her PTSD head on through one on one therapy.<br>

            Reflecting on both P.K. Philips’ and Teresa’s stories, they share that experience of retriggering moments
            and panic attacks, and feeling of wanting to do nothing. In Philips story, we see this when their PTSD was
            re-triggered and they couldn’t concentrate or do any simple tasks, and stopped normal social activities with
            friends and the community. Similarly, in Teresa’s story, after her breakthrough dreams from the painkillers
            she felt unmotivated to do anything that would’ve been considered normal for her daily routine in life. Both
            Philips and Teresa suffer from the same health issues and illness. Having been through multiple traumatic
            experiences throughout life not knowing you have PTSD until the age of 32 and experiencing a traumatic
            accident in the army are both hard experiences in life to have gone through.<br>

            Nonetheless, both these individuals were able to find ways to cope and manage their PTSD in healthy ways.
            P.K. Philips was able to finally get diagnosed and treated with the proper medication and behavior therapy
            to manage their PTSD. Teresa also found a counselor and has a support group that helps her manage her PTSD.
            Both individuals are doing their best to continue to live healthy lives that are not overpowered by their
            PTSD and have chosen to share their stories through this article and video and can inspire others suffering
            from the same thing to know they are not alone and can get the help they need through support.<br><br><br>
